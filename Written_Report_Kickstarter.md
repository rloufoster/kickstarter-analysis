# Kickstarter Campaign Outcomes based on Launch Dates and Funding Goals

## Overview 

This quantitative analysis is designed to provide insights into theater and plays fundraising campaigns based on crowdfunding site data. Two seperate analyses were prepared: Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals.

### Purpose

The purpose of this report is to provide insights into theater and plays campaign launch dates and fundraising goals data in order to guide the client in her own fundraising initiatives. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

My biggest challenge was learning to use Batch and Github. I still can't figure out how to remove unwanted files from Github, so I hope the graders are able to find my work. 

## Results

### Analysis of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

    As depicted by the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart,  April, May and June are optimal months to launch a successful campaign. The data also suggests that December is the worst month to begin a campaign regardless of whether the campaign is a success or failure. See Chart [!Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Chart](https://github.com/rloufoster/kickstarter-analysis/commit/3f5a4e955ada3f3fa7ec730f1c314436235f453f#diff-59ac868c9bd8fae746a6507c566f45a450ae08af06bfeafc9c71ecde7777262b)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal

Louise's campaign goal is $10,000.  The Outcomes Based on the Goal chart suggests that her goal might be a little high to bolster a successful camgaign.  The plays campaigns that set goals from $1000-$4999 have the highest percentage of success.  See Chart [!Outcomes Based on Goal Chart] (https://github.com/rloufoster/kickstarter-analysis/commit/3f5a4e955ada3f3fa7ec730f1c314436235f453f#diff-0a6e3f4326491bcabef6721eea9629f44441166f5585dd3455b29bed61737449)

    
### Limitations of this dataset

It would be meaningful to see the data of the corresponding platforms used for each of the campaigns (i.e., Donorbox, Fundly, GoFundMe, etc.) Does one platform provide more lucrative results?  Do some of the campaigns utilize more than one platform at a time? 

For the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date data, I might've used a Clustered Column Chart.  The columns of the clustered outcomes visualize the comparisons nicely. In addition, for the Outcomes Based on Goal chart, I might also include a Clustered Bar Chart.  Again, I like the clustered bars for visualizing the comparisons.
